About Me

A recent college graduate with a Masters in Bioinstrumentation, I am a software engineer with areas of expertise focused on data analysis, model creation, and game development. As a computational scientist with 1+ years of experience, I analyzed MRI data on breast cancer patients to develop meaningful clusters separating types of breast cancer according to MRI data alone. I also developed 5+ breast cancer drug models using Python and consulted literature online to ensure our models encapture our specific patient group with 95% certainty. As a senior game developer for ASL Aspire with 2+ years of experience, I have developed 5+ games equipped with animations, cutscenes, and stories, including 2D games, 3D games, and multiplayer games. I have also tackled creating an AI model processing video frames with an ASL sign and outputting what that sign it, which uses a combination of preprocessing scikit-learn tools and TensorFlow/PyTorch neural nets.

As a scientist my work has contributed to FDA-cleared solutions and enhancing clinical outcomes. And as a game developer my work has contributed to making STEM education accessible to all deaf kids around the world. My goal as a recent college graduate is to use the skills I have in computational programming and apply them to problems in healthcare and clinical optimizations. I want to make life easy for our doctors who are working so hard each day, and my programming background will make that possible!
